                Jamnagar, which actually means mean ‘Town of the Kings’, is a city in the district of Jamnagar, in the state of Gujarat. Owing to its abundant history, it comes as no surprise that the city is the home of a minimum of 3 palaces- the Darbargadh Palace, the Pratap Vilas Palace, and the Lakhota Palace. The Lakhota Palace is more of a fort and home to a gorgeous museum.

                Marine National Park:-
                Gujarat has the distinction of creating the country's first Marine National Park spread over an area of nearly 458 sq kms in the Gulf of Kutch, 30 kms. from Jamnagar. Here corals create fantasies in stone and are the master builders of the Park. Their limestone fortresses - each one the work of a colony of countless tiny animals - come in an amazing variety of shapes and sizes, from the convoluted brain coral to corals that look like horns.
                Turtles, shrimp, sponge, eels, sea urchin lurk among the corals and huge schools of fish create a brilliance of colours that are unknown, unseen and unimaginable. Here you can see dolphins and octopuses.
                Dugong, a marine mammal, which resembles a seal and the rare Boralia species are found in these protected areas. The park has dense mangrove growth, which provides scores of birds with nesting and roosting sites.

                Darbargadh Palace:-
                Darbargadh Palace, situated in Jamnagar city, was initially built in 1540 AD; the construction went on intermittently leading to a final masterpiece of history and architecture possessing both Rajput and European influences. It is located to the east of Chandi Chowk in Jamnagar city. Jamnagar (earlier known as Nawanagar) was founded by Jam Shri Rawalji in 1540 and Darbargadh came to become their first place of residence. Rawalji originally belonged to Kutch. The palace complex is semi-circular in shape, and the area thus created outside was earlier used by the kings to address the public.

                Lakhota Talav:-
                Lakhota Talav is one of the most beautiful and serene places of Jamnagar. Being right in the middle of the hustle and bustle of the city, the lake stands as the perfect picture of serenity. It is also known as the Ranmal Lake and surrounds Lakhota Fort, which is situated in an island inside. The lake and the palace were constructed by King of Navanagar, Jan Ranmal II in the mid-19th century AD.
                Within the palace, there is an archaeology museum which possesses sculptures (dating from 9th to 18th century), arms and firearms, medieval age pottery from surrounding villages and so on. The fort is connected with the banks through two pathways.

                Bedi Port:-
                Bedi Port lies around 8 km from Jamnagar Railway Station on the south-eastern coast of Gulf of Kutch. It is an all-weather trading hub in the Arabian Sea and one of the most prominent ones in Jamnagar. The picturesque setting of the port has made it a very popular daytrip spot in Jamnagar.
                he region of Jamnagar is known for its magnificent (resident or migratory) avian population. Winter is the best time to enjoy the climate and the brilliant birds which come here in plenty. Enroute to the Bedi Port one would also get to witness salt pans on both sides of the road. The port lies close to INS Valsura, an Indian Naval Base.
