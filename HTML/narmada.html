                Narmada District, even before the independence of India, was already one of the independent states, a Rajwada that belonged to Rajpipla. The state was later dissolved and became part of the Union of India but the name Rajpipla remained. Till the year 1997, Rajpipla was the name of the present-day Narmada District, but in 1997 Gujarat government carved out 6 new districts which were Narmada, Nandod, Dediyapada, Tilakwada Taluka, and Sagbara Taluka. Rajpipla was made the headquarters of Narmada District.
