            <p class="pera">
                Porbandar has the best of both worlds — it is neither a town nor a big city. Its roads are still dusty; the heritage buildings give a historical feel; the narrow market lanes beckon you; there are autos to take you around; the crowd is always buzzing around; every corner of the street smells of Gujarati snacks; the tobacco-chewing uncle cannot converse with you without spitting right next to you, and the best part of the city is that it can mostly be explored on foot.

                Sudama Mandir:-
                The story of Sudama is not unknown. It is a popular tale that finds mention in the Bhagavata Purana. Sudama and Krishna were childhood friends; however, they went their separate ways as they grew up. In the later years, Sudama struggled with his poverty while Krishna was, as we all know, a part of the royal family.
                A popular anecdote thus goes—One day Sudama's wife urged him to meet Krishna and request him (Krishna) to alleviate their poverty. Sudama hesitantly leaves for Dwarka to meet Krishna. He only has a fistful of beaten rice tied in a cloth as a gift to him. He reaches Dwarka and meets his friend. Krishna is joyful about seeing his childhood friend. He treats Sudama with the best of his hospitality. He then asks Sudama, "What gift do you have for your friend?" Sudama hesitantly hands over the 'potli' of beaten rice to Krishna, especially after being bestowed upon with all the riches and delicacies. However, Krishna stuffs himself with the beaten rice in great humility.
                Sudama is so overwhelmed by the love that he does not ask for anything else. He leaves the place with contentment. But when he reaches his home, lo and behold — His poverty has vanished away! There is a grand palace in place of his home, filled with all sorts of riches.

                Manek Chowk:-
                What is a city without its hustling- bustling market? And Porbandar has not one but three popular markets.
                Manek Chowk, Soni Bazar, Bhatia Bazar are all located close to each other. And if you are anything like me who loves to walk around markets and pick up local stuff, then these Chowks are a great place to be at. The markets are heavily crowded. A lot of unique and antique stuff can be found here. It also houses Ayurvedic shops, Pooja shops, flower markets — you name it, and you get it! And of course, a lot of munchy snacks too! I stuffed myself with Khaari (a puffed bakery product).

                Kirti Mandir:-
                The place needs no introduction. Kirti Mandir is the memorial built around the house in which Gandhiji was born. It is a three-story house and takes you straight away back in the times of the Mahatma. The house showcases the room where Gandhi was born, a room specifically for Kasturba Ba, and a separate reading room. The highlight of Kirti Mandir is the Mahila library and the museum housing pictures, handicrafts and the paraphernalia used by the Mahatma himself.
                The photos in the museum are well maintained. As I walked past them, they spoke volumes of history to me. From a picture showing Gandhi standing with his young bride to show people mourning at his deathbed, there are so many photos that reflect his life. His photos with the stalwarts like Nehru and Patel, the famous Dandi March; his family members; him working at his Charkha, and so much more depict his extraordinary life.
                To think that a person of such humble origins went abroad for further studies and later shook the entire world with his principles always gives one goosebump.

                Porbandar Beach / Chowpati Beach:-
                Porbandar, a tiny city, has a lot to offer. After the colourful markets and majestic palaces, it was now time to hit the beach.
                I reached the beach just in time to catch the sunset. I could see the Porbandar port at a distance from where I stood. As I sat at a comfortable spot after the day's wanderings, I admired the seagulls that were flying around. I immersed my tired legs in the calming water and bought some Kava with some hot tea spiced up with ginger and lemon. What a break after a tiring yet fruitful day! 
                The Porbandar beach is completely safe as it is well lit and has many restaurants and apartments around it. There is also a walkway; hence a lot of people can be seen walking at the beach. I decided to stay late and then dined in one of the finest restaurants overlooking the beach. The peace I felt is beyond the capability of the words to describe!

                Bileshwar Mahadev:-
                Wait, the excursion is not over yet!
                The temple has a Swaymabhu Lingam, which means that the statue was formed by itself! The legend says that Lord Krishna was once engaged in a fight with Indra. Krishna then prayed to Bileshwar Mahadev, and thus the Lingam emerged on its own! The Lingam is huge and has only a small portion visible above the ground, while about 8 feet is hidden beneath the floor.
                However, the temple does not have very striking architecture. Only the Lingam is heavily ornamental in its design. The temple is well known among the Rabari tribe. There is a huge statue of Nandi, Lord Shiva's bull, right opposite the Lingam, which is also ornately decorated.
