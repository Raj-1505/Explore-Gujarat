                It is said that king Vanraj Chavda established Champaner at the foot of Pavagadh in fond memory of his wise minister Champa. Later, the Patai Raval family ruled it and took care of the boundary. The folk tales say that Mahakali assumed the form of a woman and danced in a Garba during Navaratri. The last Patai, Jaisinh watched her with dirty looks. The deity became angry at Jaisinh and cursed him that the town will fall. The Muslim emperor of Gujarat, Mahmud Begada assaulted Pavagadh and won the hill on the boundary in the 15th century.

                Kevada Mosques:-
                Kevada Mosque is a mosque in Champaner, Gujarat state, western India. It is part of the Champaner-Pavagadh Archaeological Park, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The mosque has minarets, globe-like domes, and narrow stairs. According to Ruggles, nature was integrated into the Kevada mosque's architecture in a way that was unusual elsewhere in the Islamic world. This mosque was built in Champaner during the time of Mahmud Begada, as were several other mosques, such as the Bawaman, Ek Minar, Jama, Khajuri, Nagina, and Shahar Ki. After James Burgess and Henry Cousens wrote descriptions of the Kevada, Jama, and Nagina Mosques, roads were built to reach them. The Kevada is notable because of its mausoleum. Kathra Mosque is west of the Kevada. The mosque has many mihrabs, all intricately carved. There is a damaged brick tank for ablutions before prayers are offered at the mosque. The centotaph is square in shape with a fluted central dome and four corner domes; it is located next to the tank. The layout of the mosque is rectangular. Floral and geometrical designs adorn the niches. The tribate inter-columns are considered attractive.

                The Hathni Mata waterfalls:-
                The Hathni Mata waterfalls, one of the most beautiful waterfalls in India, are 100 meters tall and surrounded by green carpeted hills with flowers and floras. A scenic beauty of falls and wet breeze with the music of water gurgling and falling on rocks will take you to another world. The Hathni Mata waterfalls are located in Jambughoda, @30km from Pavagadh and approximately 80km from Vadodara. It is one of must-visit places in Jambughoda during rainy days of monsoon. The name Hathni was derived by the local tribal community from the rock that looks like a baby elephant in the base of the waterfall. The tribal community strongly believes in the Hathni Mata hence fairs are also held on some occasions, mainly in winter. Although Hathni Mata waterfalls are very popular among youngsters and local communities, due to location and seasonal rush, it is one of many unspoiled jewels of Jambughoda and best waterfalls near Vadodara.
