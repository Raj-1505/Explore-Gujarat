                The sprawling, bustling city of Rajkot in Gujrat’s Saurashtra region is not the first destination that
                comes to mind when you thinking of a holiday here. But, there are good number of places to visit in
                Rajkot that introduce you to its history and let you explore its natural allure.
                Among the many must-sees are the home of Gandhi’s childhood, a museum that lets you take a walk through
                Rajkot’s history and a library with a vast collection of books that showcase Gujarati literature. As you
                head out of the city, there are dams and lakes just waiting to be explored.
