                The city of Dwarka in the state of Gujarat is one of the most ancient and the loveliest of cities in India. Located on the banks of the river Gomati, this city is known for its rich culture and heritage. The entire city of Dwarka has several tales to tell of Lord Krishna and his childhood. Lord Krishna here is called by the name, Dwarkadeesh. Due to the presence of the Jyotirlingas, Dwarka is also one amongst a lot of other holy sacred shrines for Hindus in India. There are a lot of temples to visit when you are in Dwarka but, apart from that, there are many other things to do in Dwarka, Gujarat. The city also has an association with Mahabharata; hence, it has a lot of significance.

                Camel riding on the banks of Gomti River is one of the most famous things to do in Dwarka. Looking at the children having fun during the camel ride and understanding the history of five sweet water wells brought by five different rishis can be mesmeric. Enjoying the sight of the Ghats on one bank while you ride on camelback on the other bank is a great experience.

                People who visit Dwarka generally visit the Krishna temple in Bet Dwarka too. The temple is about an hour and a half journey from the city of Dwarka, and a ferry ride to this temple can be a fantastic experience. The Krishna temple here is surrounded by islands; hence, this is one of the top things to do in Dwarka.

                Sudhama, the best friend of Lord Krishna, also has his presence in the land of Dwarka. The bridge that connects both sides of the Gomti River is called Sudhama Setu, and watching the sunrise from this place can be truly enchanting. This is also one of the top things to do in Dwarka.
