                Kutch is famous for a few things: first and foremost it is known for its rich traditions in handicrafts
                and the craft market that takes place every winter. It’s also famous for the Great Rann of Kutch: a huge
                salt marsh located in the Thar desert – stretching from Kutch into the Sindh region of southern
                Pakistan.
                Many of those who come to visit Kutch, Gujarat, come to see the famous Great Rann, one of the largest
                salt marshes in the world.
                I’d come for a slightly different reason. I’d come to Bhuj, the capital of the Kutch region in Gujarat
                to visit the award-winning Kutch Adventures India, who’ve been recognised internationally for their
                efforts in responsible tourism, through promoting better engagement of people across cultures.

                The Rann of Kutch is famous for hosting the annual Kutch Festival or the Kutch Rann Utsav. An integral
                part of Kutch tourism, the Festival is an annual cultural extravaganza that turns the white Rann of
                Kutch into a colourful canvas.
                Organized and conducted by the tourism of Gujarat, the winter event is usually held between November and
                February. The idea is to celebrate the folk culture of Kutch and experience the natural marvel of the
                white desert of Kutch. The three-four months of gala showcases folk dances, work of art, sightseeing,
                adventure activities, music, and other exciting events.
                The festival spans the entire district, starting at Bhuj, and ending at the Rann Utsav tent city, built
                on the salt flats. There are 400 tents built near a small village called Dhordo, close to the Bhuj
                airport. The dates for the 2021 Kutch Festival are from November 12, 2021, to February 28, 2022.

                This district is home to the Kutchi people who speak the Kutchi language. Although a part of Gujarat,
                their art and culture are quite distinctive from the rest of the state. Kutch embroidery and Kutch
                handicrafts are quite popular both locally and internationally. But the Rann of Kutch festival is what
                this place is famous for. Among other tourist places in Kutch, Bhuj festival is the one that attracts
                people from all over the world.
